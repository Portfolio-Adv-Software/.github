# Personal Leadership
## Koen Evers

The purpose of this document is to describe my plans to grow as a Software Engineer and detail my considerations for the future.

## Internship
My internship was at Conneqtech. A company that provides APIs/Software as a Service/IoT solutions. My task was to assess bottlenecks in a specific microservice and create more capacity for this service. I was also tasked to add some functionality to this service.
I learned a lot at this internship. I enjoyed working at a small company with a flat hierarchy. What went really well is figuring out what approach to take with this internship. Working together with a professional scrum team went very well too. I noticed that writing my internship report was a struggle for me though.
I struggled somewhat to keep to my research plan or atleast document everything I did on time. This caused me to have a bit of a difficult time at the end of my internship.

## Semester 7
I will be starting advanced game design & technology. I chose this semester because it is a very fun semester and promotes creative thinking and design. My fellow students from semester 4 will also be doing this semester again.
I had considered and was selected for a Minor Abroad in Canada but unfortunately this appeared to be financially unviable and I had to pull out of this.

## Semester 8

For Semester 8, my graduation internship I have multiple options.
- I can join my fellow game design students in creating a game development company and graduate there.
- I can look for a software internship.

For my Software internship I have a few companies I'd be interested in.

1. Hulan: A serious gaming company that should blend my interest in Software design and game design.
2. Afas: A common name in Software. A huge company with a reputation of being a good employer.
3. SRON: Dutch space research institute. Often has projects they need people for, an interesting field to get started in.
4. De Twee Snoeken: An Architects company near me that builds this our own design software, could be an interesting field.
5. NS: dutch railway company which has interesting job openings.
6. Pipple: Eindhoven based data science company recommended to me by a friend in the industry. They are looking for software engineers to help build their data science ambitions.

I have emailed most of these companies to see if they are willing to meet with me so that I can explore what kind of company they are. I hope that this will be happening over summer.

## Future
I am looking to find relevant headhunters so I can build a proper network to look for jobs that fit me as a person. I have emailed some companies that I think are interesting to see what headhunters they use and like or if they can put me in contact with good headhunters.
I am looking for a software job where I can use modern technologies, work in a small team and where the hierarchy is somewhat flat.
