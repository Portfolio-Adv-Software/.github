## Koen Evers

The purpose of this document is to describe my plans to grow as a Software Engineer and detail my considerations for the future.

## Semester 7
I will be starting advanced game design & technology. I chose this semester because it is a very fun semester and promotes creative thinking and design. My fellow students from semester 4 will also be doing this semester again.
I had considered and was selected for a Minor Abroad in Canada but unfortunately this appeared to be financially unviable.

## Semester 8

For Semester 8, my graduation internship I have multiple options.
- I can join my fellow game design students in creating a company and graduate there.
- I can look for a software internship.

For my Software internship I have a few companies I'd be interested in.
1. Hulan: A serious gaming company that should blend my interest in Software design and game design.
2. Afas: A common name in Software. A huge company with a reputation of being a good employer.
3. SRON: Dutch space research institute. Often has projects they need people for, an interesting field to get started in.
4. De Twee Snoeken: An Architects company near me that builds this our own design software, could be an interesting field.
