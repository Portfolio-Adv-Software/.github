# Reading guide

## Introduction
This document is created to help the reader use this document to easily find certain products and sum up all the context. The reading guide is written for my personal portfolio to prove my level of proficiency on some enterprise software engineering topics. There are nine learning outcomes that are related to this topic and need proof of my knowledge I will be gathering during this semester. To proof this I will be working on two projects: a group and individual project. 

### Group project - Stockbrood
The group project will be done by our group existing of five students and one product owner (PO). The PO is a trader on multiple markets and is looking for a way to automate testing his trading strategies. Everything about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/S-A-RB05).


### Individual project - Kwetter
The invidiual project is the sensible default project "Kwetter" 


### Start
<Explain your starting knowledge, experience, interests and what you would like to learn and achieve this semester>.



## Learning outcomes
Scale for every learning outcomes: undefined, orienting, beginning, proficient, advanced.

### Learning outcome 1 - Future-oriented Organization
You develop and deploy enterprise software, both individually and as a team, that fits the current question and needs of your stakeholders. Your final solution is designed with the possibility for future further development. 

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
This sprint I spent time orientating on which technologies fit and are suited for our specific enterprise needs. A lot of work went into the project plan and the general exploration of our group project's needs.

1.2: Sprint 1
I made a C2 Diagram and created a demo for Angular and the use of grpc with protobuf.







### Learning Outcome 2 - Investigative Problem-Solving
You deliver professional products according to planning, which is the result of solving problems in a structured and methodical approach. You demonstrate a critical view towards your own and other people’s work. 

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
This sprint I spent time orientating on which technologies fit and are suited for our specific enterprise needs. A lot of work went into the project plan and the general exploration of our group project's needs.

1.2: Sprint 1
I wrote a researchplan for my individual research that will help the group project ass well as my individual project. This plan can be found [here](TBD).





### Learning Outcome 3 - Personal Leadership
You acquire skills required for your future career. You are aware of multiple career paths and can reflect which ones fit best, considering your (potential) skills and ambitions. You are aware of developments in software engineering and can signal trends. 

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 1
I am looking into locations for graduation internships at the moment and have already written to multiple companies. More details will be in [this document](TBD) which should help to support this learning outcome.












### Learning Outcome 4 - Targeted Interaction
You use appropriate communication considering your role in a team, your audience and the medium to convey your message and results of your software development process.

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
We do stand ups to inform eachother what we did and will be working on. We also created a Jira board with userstories that have story points assigned to them which are based off of the planning poker session we did as a group.
Finally we made a group contract so that we have a fallback document for when normal cooperation is no longer possible.









### Learning Outcome 5 - Scalable Architectures
Besides functionality, you develop the architecture of enterprise software based on quality attributes. You especially consider attributes most relevant to enterprise contexts with high volume data and events. You design your architecture with future adaptation in mind. Your development environment supports this by being able to independently deploy and monitor the running parts of your application. 

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
I spent time looking at which technologies to include into our techstack. I ended up proposing Go, gRPC and RabbitMQ as some of our significant technologies. I am currently working on a document to justify these choices.

1.2: Sprint 1
For my individual project I created a C2 model which can be found [here](TBD). 
I also spent some time working on a gRPC and Protobuf demo which can be found [here](TBD).
Finally I made a small Angular demo to get used to this front-end. This can be found [here](TBD).






### Learning Outcome 6 - Development and Operations (DevOps)
You set up environments and tools which support your chosen software development process. You provide governance for all stakeholders’ goals. You aim for as much automation as possible, to enable short release times and high software quality.

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Undefined |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Undefined |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0


1.2: Sprint 1






### Learning Outcome 7 - Cloud Services
You can explain what a cloud platform provider is and can deploy (parts of) your application to a cloud platform. You integrate cloud services (for example: Serverless computing, cloud storage, container management) into your enterprise application, and can explain the added value of these cloud services for your application.

#### Score

1.2: Sprint 1




### Learning Outcome 9 – Distributed Data
You are aware of specific data requirements for enterprise systems. You apply best practices for distributed data during your whole development process, both for non-functional and functional requirements. You especially take legal and ethical issues into consideration.

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Undefined |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Undefined |

#### Substantiation

## Reflection
Reflect here on your (study) process per sprint.
Where are you getting stuck, what is going well, where do you need help. This is not about the content; you have described this in the learning outcomes. 

### Sprint 1
Unfortunately I was sick for a fair bit during this sprint. Suffering from Migraines and either covid or a strong flu saw me miss out on quite a few days. To compound this I also put too much focus on the group project this sprint and struggled to find a good balance between individual and group project. This explains the weak progress this sprint and is also something to pay attention to for next sprint.


## Conclusion
Here, at the end of the semester, you reflect on your process and end result. You can also refer back to the goals you set in the introduction, to see to what extent you were able to achieve them. 
Also mention what you are proud of, what you would like to do differently in the coming semesters and whether you have come to different insights about the field of study. Is there perhaps a particular subject you would like to explore further?
