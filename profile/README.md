# Reading guide
# Koen Evers

## Introduction
This is the reading guide to my portfolio. This is still a WIP. The aim of this document is to direct you to what I've done and explain why/what I made.
If there are any questions feel free to let me know through teams, canvas or let me know when I'm in Eindhoven.

### Group project - Stockbrood
The group project will be done by our group existing of five students and one product owner (PO). The PO is a trader on multiple markets and is looking for a way to automate testing his trading strategies. Everything about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/S-A-RB05).


### Individual project - Kwetter
The invidiual project is the sensible default project "Kwetter" which can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter). 

### Start
I would like to learn about microservices, cloudhosting, docker and messaging in this semester. During my internship I got to experience working within microservices and make code function with messaging but I did not get the chance to design these systems. I'm eager to get personal experience with this.



## Learning outcomes
Scale for every learning outcomes: undefined, orienting, beginning, proficient, advanced.

### Learning outcome 1 - Future-oriented Organization
You develop and deploy enterprise software, both individually and as a team, that fits the current question and needs of your stakeholders. Your final solution is designed with the possibility for future further development.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0


This sprint I spent time orientating on which technologies fit and are suited for our specific enterprise needs. A lot of work went into the project plan and the general exploration of our group project's needs.

1.2: Sprint 1


I made a [C2 Diagram](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/blob/main/.Documentation/C2%20Individueel.png) and created a demo for Angular and the use of grpc with protobuf. Furthermore I helped my team create userstories for Stockbrood.

1.3: Sprint 2


I made a [document](https://github.com/S-A-RB05/.github/blob/main/profile/Technology%20justification.md) with my group in which we justify the technological choices we made for our project. I am also attempting to deploy my services in the cloud and preparing them to be scalable.

1.4: Sprint 3


I am thinking about how we can arrange the code in our group project to be easier to work on and to be better transferable to new teams. This involves ensuring proper decoupling of code.

1.5 Sprint 4


I worked on decoupling code and started thinking about our handover document

1.6 Sprint 5


I helped create the handover document for the group project with my team.






### Learning Outcome 2 - Investigative Problem-Solving
You deliver professional products according to planning, which is the result of solving problems in a structured and methodical approach. You demonstrate a critical view towards your own and other people’s work.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0


This sprint I spent time orientating on which technologies fit and are suited for our specific enterprise needs. A lot of work went into the project plan and the general exploration of our group project's needs.

1.2: Sprint 1


I made a research plan that should be relevant to both my individual project and the group project. This plan can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/blob/main/Documentation/annotated-ResearchPlan-KoenEvers.pdf).

1.3: Sprint 2


I have been gathering knowledge on my research project. and hope to conclude it in sprint 3 or 4. I also researched what the tech stack for my group project should look like and substantiated why in this [document](https://github.com/S-A-RB05/.github/blob/main/profile/Technology%20justification.md)

1.4: Sprint 3


I started making prototypes and combining a lot of my research documents together into one. I believe I am nearly done and will finish this in sprint 4.

1.5 Sprint 4


I finished my research, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/blob/main/TracingResearch.pdf), and prototype, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/TracingPoC), to support this research.





### Learning Outcome 3 - Personal Leadership
You acquire skills required for your future career. You are aware of multiple career paths and can reflect which ones fit best, considering your (potential) skills and ambitions. You are aware of developments in software engineering and can signal trends.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 1


I am looking into locations for graduation internships at the moment and have already written to multiple companies. More details will be in [this document](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/blob/main/Personal%20Leadership.md) which should help to support this learning outcome.

1.2: Sprint 2


I have updated my plans a bit more and looked at more prospective internships and future career paths.

1.3 Sprint 3


I have contacted multiple companies to ask for a meeting to explore the company culture and see if they are interesting places for me to be in the future. I have also started thinking about potential headhunters with whom I can build a professional relationship with.

1.4 Sprint 4


Not much happened this sprint, I found a few extra companies that I contacted.

1.5 Sprint 5


I have now scheduled multiple talks with companies during summer.












### Learning Outcome 4 - Targeted Interaction
You use appropriate communication considering your role in a team, your audience and the medium to convey your message and results of your software development process.


#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0

We do stand ups to inform eachother what we did and will be working on. We also created a Jira board with userstories that have story points assigned to them which are based off of the planning poker session we did as a group.
Finally we made a group contract so that we have a fallback document for when normal cooperation is no longer possible.

We also ended our sprint with peer feedback.

1.2: Sprint 1

We improved our standups with feedback from our semestercoach. We updated the userstories on our Jira board based on our stakeholder feedback.
We made sure to create tasks for our userstories and keep them updated during the sprint.

1.3: Sprint 2

We improved our deliveries to the stakeholder by clearly showing what we worked on, what was completed and what was not done yet and why.

1.4: Sprint 3

Our deliveries are going well and we are now showing more of our progress instead of just telling about our progress.

1.5 Sprint 4

Our sprints keep improving and we are moving to handover.

1.6 Sprint 5

Handover.

# ===================================





### Learning Outcome 5 - Scalable Architectures
Besides functionality, you develop the architecture of enterprise software based on quality attributes. You especially consider attributes most relevant to enterprise contexts with high volume data and events. You design your architecture with future adaptation in mind. Your development environment supports this by being able to independently deploy and monitor the running parts of your application.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0

I spent time looking at which technologies to include into our techstack. I ended up proposing Go, gRPC and RabbitMQ as some of our significant technologies. I am currently working on a document to justify these choices.

1.2: Sprint 1

For my individual project I created a C2 model which can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/blob/main/.Documentation/Kwetter.drawio.png). 

1.3: Sprint 2

I created a monorepo for my project with a TweetService and TrendService. The two services can communicate with eachother through RabbitMQ with protobuf messages, these messages are in a binary format and are very quickly encoded and decoded which is great for microservices. The two services use MongoDB as their datastore. MongoDB and RabbitMQ are already online and hosted in the cloud.

1.4: Sprint 3

I have created Dockerfiles for my services and setup a pipeline on github to automaticaly build and push these images to a dockerhub repo. I have also added a basic authservice, userservice and gateway service which is still WIP. I plan to automaticaly deploy to an Azure kubernetes environment.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/73a1cdd8-4bfa-41c0-a249-a377e75b98b4)

1.5: Sprint 4

I further implemented and refactored my gateway and authservice. the gateway is capable of handling grpc and http requests though http could use some more support. I do not consider further http support a priority at the moment however.

1.6 Sprint 5

I have deployed my application to the cloud! It is now running and accessible on Azure.
I have made a resource mapping document which should substantiate some of my load testing. This document can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/blob/main/.Documentation/Resource%20Mapping.pdf).
I also did some loadtesting with Jmeter to test the scaling of the application, specifically the authservice.

### Learning Outcome 6 - Development and Operations (DevOps)
You set up environments and tools which support your chosen software development process. You provide governance for all stakeholders’ goals. You aim for as much automation as possible, to enable short release times and high software quality.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0

Did not do much for DevOps yet.

1.2: Sprint 1

Helped group with setting up ci/cd

1.3: Sprint 2

Created Dockerfile.

1.4: Sprint 3

Setup a pipeline to automaticaly build and push images to a dockerhub repo

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/99a3b058-4cdd-4e7d-8315-518e0a7720a9)

1.5 Sprint 4

I added improved pipelines to my microservices. They now check specific subdirectories for changes and only that which has been changed. This is useful as I run a monorepo. 

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/12758bdb-0a17-41ca-a2c6-edc0609858c8)

I can now manually trigger my gitactions. 

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/f51cbfc2-accc-44fc-925f-6eafde02735e)

I also added a sonarcloud code quality check.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/1fbc6b34-b395-4a7c-ac88-cbc90cd68152)


1.6 Sprint 5

I wrote code to test my application. I integrated this into my pipeline. The tests see if my authservice works properly and returns the appropiate codes when needed.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/6f807477-0a8c-4955-a1e5-232323963f84)

### Learning Outcome 7 - Cloud Services
You can explain what a cloud platform provider is and can deploy (parts of) your application to a cloud platform. You integrate cloud services (for example: Serverless computing, cloud storage, container management) into your enterprise application, and can explain the added value of these cloud services for your application.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0

1.2: Sprint 1

1.3: Sprint 2

I setup a RabbitMQ environment in the cloud and also setup a MongoDB in the cloud.

1.4: Sprint 3

I am now automaticaly pushing images to dockerhub and have setup my account to get started with deploying to azure.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/d66b8308-a3f1-4b58-9656-400c8420760e)

1.5: Sprint 4

I attempted to run my microservices as images on dockerdesktop and on a local cluster using minikube but encountered problems with the dns.

1.6: Sprint 5

I have now setup my application in the cloud on Azure using AKS.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/39bdfc50-4e24-4318-bb7e-23d1ec26d76f)


### Learning Outcome 8 - Security by Design
You investigate how to minimize security risks for your application, and you incorporate best practices in your whole software development process.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0

1.2: Sprint 1

1.3: Sprint 2

1.4: Sprint 3

I created dockerhub secrets to create a pipeline that pushes images to a dockerhub repo. I also hid nearly all hard-coded credentials for databases and messaging platforms in .env files and setup my git pipeline to properly utilise these credentials with repo secrets and environment secrets.

1.5: Sprint 4

I am now hiding all credentials in secrets. I also installed sonarcloud and performed security analysis to find hotspots.

1.6 Sprint 5

I fixed security hotspots. I also made an OWASP document where I look at the top 10 security risks and see how they apply to my application, this can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/blob/main/.Documentation/Security.pdf). I also made my authentication service which can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/tree/main/AuthService). This service works by using JWT tokens and hashed passwords.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/0b7782f5-d367-4c7c-bf37-896ac3f3d4d3)


![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/59307eb2-3861-40d2-9ab0-11e842f4840f)

I created an interceptor for my gateway which checks incoming requests and sees if they need to be validated. If it does it makes a request to the authservice validate endpoint and checks the token. If validation is succesful it passes the request to the appropiate handler.

### Learning Outcome 9 – Distributed Data
You are aware of specific data requirements for enterprise systems. You apply best practices for distributed data during your whole development process, both for non-functional and functional requirements. You especially take legal and ethical issues into consideration.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0


1.2: Sprint 1


1.3: Sprint 2

I have multiple microservices using grpc that have their own Mongodb, because of the microservice architecture I paid attention to what database needs to be stored in duplicate across different services. Some of these microservices can communicate with eachother through rabbitmq.

1.4: Sprint 3

I am looking into setting up a RabbitMQ queue to start a transaction which lets a User delete all of their data. To do so I am refactoring my gateway and datamodels.

1.5: Sprint 4

I made a GDPR required endpoint to be able to delete ALL user data, I do this by using RabbitMQ which sends a message on the queue to all relevant services to delete their data.

1.6 Sprint 5

I created [this](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/Kwetter/blob/main/.Documentation/Distributed%20Data.pdf) distributed data document in which I describe how the flow in some of my endpoints work and how the data gets handled. I also describe how I applied GDPR standards.

The extra things I did for GDPR this sprint are:

I now ask the user for permission to handle/store their data when they register.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/ea40b7a1-fe86-4502-bc94-dcd80482cadc)

I made it so a user can ask to see what data my program has of them.

![image](https://github.com/Portfolio-Adv-Software/.github/assets/78910809/70c37a04-7348-4c33-a81d-517e6268ad25)




## Reflection
Reflect here on your (study) process per sprint.
Where are you getting stuck, what is going well, where do you need help. This is not about the content; you have described this in the learning outcomes. 

### Sprint 1
Unfortunately I was sick for a fair bit during this sprint. Suffering from Migraines and either covid or a strong flu saw me miss out on quite a few days. To compound this I also put too much focus on the group project this sprint and struggled to find a good balance between individual and group project. This explains the weak progress this sprint and is also something to pay attention to for next sprint.


## Conclusion
Here, at the end of the semester, you reflect on your process and end result. You can also refer back to the goals you set in the introduction, to see to what extent you were able to achieve them. 
Also mention what you are proud of, what you would like to do differently in the coming semesters and whether you have come to different insights about the field of study. Is there perhaps a particular subject you would like to explore further?
